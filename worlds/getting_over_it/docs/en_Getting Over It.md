# Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy

## What is this game?

Getting Over It is a game about climbing a mountain, partly made out of random objects, with nothing but a hammer. The 
combination of unusual movement controlling, having no save points, and constantly hearing the narrator, the creator 
Bennett Foddy, talking about how he made the game, philosophical topics, and how sorry he feels whenever the player 
looses progress, make it one of the most well known frustration inducing games on the internet.

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure
and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

The gameplay is not randomized in any way, but movement is nerved to create some kind of dependency on items and 
continuing saves is disabled to prevent cheating.

## What is the goal of Getting Over It in Archipelago?

Reaching the top of the mountain. Maybe even multiple times depending on player options.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

- Gravity reductions (so you can move more easily)
- Goal height reductions (so you don't have to climb to the very top to finish)
- Wind traps (permanent wind blowing sometimes to the left and sometimes to the right)
- Frustration (useless filler item for item links)

## What is considered a location check?

- Touching certain points of interest with the hammer (e.g. the tree at the start or the snake ride)
- Reaching the top X times (depending on player options)

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

Nothing, except for its effect.

## But I'm not that good at the game...

You can adjust the difficulty of the logical requirements in the player options, so that even less skilled players have 
a chance of reaching the top in their world.

## Can I use this mod to see the secret at the top of the mountain, even though I'm not skilled enough?

No.
