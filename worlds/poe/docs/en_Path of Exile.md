# Archipelago Randomizer for Path of Exile (PC)


## What does randomization do to this game?

This `.apworld` does not modify Path of Exile directly, it:
- Reads your character data through an API.
- Reads your PoE client logs.
- Writes to an item filter (and can place audio files) to highlight AP items.
- Checks that you are using the items / gems that you have received. And sends checks when you find new items or level up.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

### Locations (checks)
- Finding certain base item types that drop from monsters (e.g., a specific sword base).
- Leveling up.

### Items (unlocks)
- Available characters
- Ascendancies
- Passive skill points
- Ability to equip certain gear rarities
- Ability to equip flasks
- Maximum allowed number of linked sockets
- Utility gems (auras, movement skills, curses, etc.)
- Skill gems (active attack/spell abilities)
- Support gems (that empower skill gems)


## How It Works (Read-Only Integration)

### Core loop
1. **Enter a zone** → the client validates your current gear and progression.
2. **Pick up items** → The filter should make clear what items will unlock things.
3. **Enter a new zone** → “checks” are sent for newly found items/conditions.

## What does another world's item look like in Path of Exile?
- Items from other players will be highlighted in your item filter.
- If enabled there will be audio cues for what an item will unlock when you pick it up and change zones.

Example options:
I want to use my own end-game character, and go from nothing to mapping to a boss.
- Disable levels as checks.
- Enable passive skill points as unlocks.
- Respec my character, removing all passive points, and start with no gear.
- enable boss as a goal

  ```
    start_inventory:
    # Start with these items.
